I am a Statistics graduate from the University of Toronto. This website will include my previous projects and will also include projects I am currently working on.

Some of the things I have done in the past include:

* Creation of modules on the DoSS toolkit ([dosstoolkit.com](dosstoolkit.com))
* Various data analysis projects, including a projection of the 2020 US election using MRP. Found [here](https://github.com/matthewwankiewicz/US_election_forecast/blob/main/outputs/paper/forecasting_us_election_2020.pdf)
