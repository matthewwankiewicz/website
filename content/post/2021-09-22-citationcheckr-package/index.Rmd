The `pkgdown` website can be seen below. A link to the actual website can be found [here](https://matthewwankiewicz.github.io/citationcheckR/). The package is used to automatic citations of other packages and is intended for people writing academic papers. The package will either take a list of packages you want to cite, or will take the loaded in packages and create citations for them.
